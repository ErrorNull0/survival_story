### 'item name' is the unique technical code name of the item
### 'inventory texture' the texture image shown within inventory and formspecs

### 'display name' is the item's name as shown in bold on item info panel
### 'descriptor' is a one word descriptor shown in parenthesis next to the display name
### 'item type' is for object registration, whether it's a craftitem, node, or tool
### 'node type' is only present if 'item type' is a node. it specifies three types of nodes:
###   'node:solid', 'node:nonsolid_dig', 'node:nonsolid_nodig', 'node:gappy_dig', 'node:gappy_nodig'
### 'item category' is an arbituary field representing the category, and shown below the display name
### 'item group' is not displayed anywhere, but used for crafting recipe info
### 'inventory sound' the sound when item being moved within inventory slots
### 'punch air sound' the sound when wielding and swinging the item
### 'punch hit sound' the sound when wielding the item and hitting a node or entity
### 'consume sound' the sound when eating or using the item as a consumable
### 'break sound' the sound when the item is worn out
### Note: food does not have 'punch air sound' since 'consume sound' plays instead
### Note: food containers do not have 'punch air sound' since that is handled by
### its custom 'on_use' function
### 'weight' item's wieght. used in many aspects of the game mechanics
### 'fuel burn time' is how many seconds it will burn as fuel. if value is zero,
### the item is not burnable and cannot be placed into the fuel slot. must be
### whole number, and currently follow these conventions:
###   normal grass clump burns 5 seconds
###   normal leaves clump burns 10 seconds
###   stick burns 60 seconds
###   wood burns 360 seconds
###   apple burns 5 seconds (fleshy stuff don't give off much flame)
###   charcoal burns 80% duration of a stick
### 'cook time' is generally 3x the fuel burn time, unless it's uncookable like charcoal
### cook time for meats: beefk, pork, and mutton 60 seconds, poultry 45 seconds
### set cook time to 0 for nonflammables. ITEM_COOK_PATH is what actually determines if it's cookable.
### 'value' the base monetary value of the item
### 'hit damage' can be any value, but note that fists are defined at value 1.5
### 'hit cooldown time' can range from zero to 'HIT_COOLDOWN_MAX' which is currently 4.
###   Fists cooldown time is 1.0 by default. so most items should be equal or higher.
### 'hit type' the item can inflict: fist, blunt, blade, piercing
### 'pointing range' is optional. if left blank, it defaults to 1.4m. all 'ss:' CRAFTITEMS
### have their ranges defined in global_vars_init.lua, 'default:' TOOLS overridden in
### tool_overrides.lua, and 'default:' NODES in node_overrides.lua
###   ranges of at least 0.4 to allow player to hit anything in directly front or directly above
###   ranges of at least 1.7 to allow player to hit the ground at their feet without crouching
###   ranges of at least 2.65 to allow player to nerd pole upward
###   ranges of at least 2.7 to allow player to place node one space below their feet
### 'short description' is the main short description shown within the item info panel
### 'long description' the detailed description shown as the tooltip text over the item icon
