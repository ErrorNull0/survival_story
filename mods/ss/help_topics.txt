= harvesting
<img name=ss_help_harvesting><b>Harvesting</b> is when you <b>dig,</b> <b>mine,</b> or <b>destroy</b> an object in the world in order to retrieve its <b>underlying resource.</b><br>The <b>base materials</b> that objects in the world typically fall into are <b>snappy,</b> <b>crumbly,</b> <b>choppy,</b> and <b>cracky.</b><br>The <b>base material</b> that objects consists of impact <b>how effective</b> certain tools can harvest it. Refer to the main <b>Tools topic</b> for detailed info on the <b>types of tools.</b>
- snappy
<img name=ss_help_harvesting_snappy><b>Snappy</b> objects are mostly <b>small plant life,</b> like grass, leaves, pine needles, papyrus, shrub, bush, fern, sapling, kelp, and coral (green, pink, cyan).<br>These objects are most effectively harvested using <b>bladed tools</b> like shears, machetes, sickles, and even swords and sharpened stones.
- choppy
<img name=ss_help_harvesting_choppy><b>Choppy</b> objects consists of <b>dense wood,</b> like tree trunks, bush stems, and wooden constructions like fences, doors, stairs, etc.<br><b>Axes</b> are best at destroying and harvesting these objects.
- crumbly
<img name=ss_help_harvesting_crumbly><b>Crumbly</b> objects are <b>dense materials</b> like dirt, sandstone, and clay, but also <b>loose material</b> like sand, gravel, and snow.<br><b>Shovels</b> are most effective at harvesting these objects.
- cracky
<img name=ss_help_harvesting_cracky><b>Cracky</b> objects consists of dense and <b>hard material that cracks,</b> like stone, brick, concrete, hard coral, steel, glass, and solid ice.<br>A <b>pickaxe</b> is the best tool and destroying and harvesting these objects.

= tools
<img name=ss_help_tools><b>Tools</b> are items you <b>weild</b> in order to help <b>destroy</b> or <b>harvest</b> objects. <b>Longer tools</b> have farther reach (or <b>hit range</b>), <b>heavier tools</b> use up more <b>stamina</b> with each swing, and <b>higher quality</b> tools degrade much slower (<b>better condition</b>) than others.<br><img name=ss_help_tools_2>Certain types of tools are more effective at destroying or harvesting objects constructed of <b>certain types of materials.</b> Refer to the main <b>Harvesting topic</b> for more info relating to the <b>base material types</b> of objects.<br><img name=ss_help_tools_3>The <b>type of tool</b> being used for the job is <b>important,</b> and these tool types include <b>axes,</b> <b>picks,</b> <b>shovels,</b> <b>sharp blades,</b> and <b>motorized.</b><br><img name=ss_help_tools_4>Destroying or harvesting objects with your <b>bare hands</b> is possible, but only against a limited range of objects like <b>small plant life</b> and <b>loose dirt</b> and <b>snow.</b><br>Tools can also be used as <b>weapons</b> to attack creatures. Refer to the main <b>Weapons topic</b> for more info on the tool properties that relate to <b>attacking creatures.</b>
- hit range
The overall <b>length</b> of the tool determines the <b>farthest distance</b> in meters you can be from your target and <b>still hit it</b> with the tool.<br><img name=ss_help_tools_range>For example, a <b>stone axe</b> has a hit range of <b>1.6,</b> while a <b>stone shovel's</b> hit range is <b>1.9.</b><br><img name=ss_help_tools_range_2>If not wielding anything, the hit range of your <b>bare hands</b> is <b>1.4.</b> Wielding <b>very small</b> or <b>limp items</b> (e.g., blueberries, grass, string) do not provide any additional reach and thus has the <b>same hit range</b> as your <b>bare hands.</b><br><img name=ss_help_tools_range_3>While standing upright, objects <b>directly at your feet</b> (like the ground or small stones and sticks) may not be strikable if what you're wielding has a hit range that is <b>too short</b> - this includes your <b>bare hands</b> and <b>short tools</b> like stone axes.<br><img name=ss_help_tools_range_4>You must either <b>crouch</b> in order to reach it, or wield a <b>longer item,</b> like a stick or shovel.<br><img name=ss_help_tools_range_5>Your ability to <b>pickup dropped items</b> also relies on the <b>hit range</b> of what you are wielding. If you cannot reach a dropped item, switch to a tool or item with greater reach like a stick or shovel.
- stamina
<img name=ss_help_tools_stamina>The action of <b>swinging any tool</b> or item consumes your <b>stamina,</b> regardless if the target object was hit.<br><img name=ss_help_tools_stamina_2>The amount of <b>stamina used</b> depends on the <b>item's weight.</b> The <b>heavier</b> the item being swung, the <b>more stamina</b> it requires from you. Swinging your <b>bare hands</b> takes up the <b>least amount</b> of stamina.<br><img name=ss_help_tools_stamina_3>Use the <b>item info panel</b> in your main inventory window to <b>compare the weights</b> of different items.<br>To <b>conserve stamina</b> while harvesting, attacking, or picking up dropped items, use your <b>bare hands</b> or use <b>lighter weight tools</b> instead of heavier ones.
- condition
Tools and weapons <b>wear out</b> over time while <b>harvesting resources</b> and <b>attacking creatures.</b> Items made of more <b>durable material</b> are <b>more resistent</b> to wear.<br><img name=ss_help_tools_condition>The <b>current wear</b> of a tool or weapon is shown by the <b>horizontal green bar.</b> Once this wear indicator is completely <b>depleted,</b> the item is <b>destroyed.</b><br><style color=#c0a267>Tools and weapons wear out quicker if used against the 'wrong' object.

- axes
<img float=left name=ss_help_tools_axes><b>Axes</b> are <b>not effective</b> on material like <b>dirt,</b> clay, stone, metal, or <b>loose material</b> like gravel and sand.<br>Striking an axe on <b>hard surfaces</b> like stone and metal will cause <b>more wear than normal</b> on the tool.<br>The <b>hit range</b> of most axes is <b>not that great,</b> requiring you to <b>crouch</b> if an object directly <b>under your feet</b> must be reached.<br><img name=ss_help_tools_axes_2>An axe is <b>most effective</b> on dense <br>wooden objects</b> like trees, bush stems, branches, any <b>wooden construction</b> like doors, walls, fences, materials like <b>cloth</b> and <b>leather,</b> and <b>fleshy matter.</b>
- blades
<img float=left name=ss_help_tools_blades>Some examples of <b>bladed tools</b> include <b>sharpened stone,</b> machetes, shears, knives, and swords.

= weapons
<b>Any item</b> you wield for the purpose of <b>inflicting damage</b> against an animal or creature can be considered a <b>weapon.</b><br><img name=ss_help_weapons>Along with items traditionally viewed as weapons like <b>knives,</b> <b>axes,</b> <b>swords,</b> and <b>firearms,</b> all other items like <b>construction tools,</b> <b>food containers,</b> and <b>clothing,</b> can be used as a wepon - but some can be <b>quite ineffective.</b><br>When attempting to <b>strike at</b> an animal or creature, the wielded item has <b>four 'attack' properties</b> that comes into play - its <b>damage value,</b> <b>hit range,</b> <b>cooldown time,</b> and <b>hit type.</b><br><img name=ss_help_weapons_2>These <b>attack properties</b> can be seen from the main inventory window. From there, drag any item into the <b>'?' slot</b> of the item info area. Below the item's image is its <b>attributes</b> like <b>weight</b> and <b>fuel burn time.</b> Look for the <b>attack attribute</b> (small sword). The number next to it is the <b>damage value</b> property.<br>By <b>hovering your mouse</b> over the <b>attack attribute,</b> a <b>pop-up</b> will show the values for the <b>other three attack properties</b> - <b>hit range,</b> <b>cooldown time,</b> and <b>hit type.</b>
- damage
<style color=#c0a267>The item's damage value plays a factor on how much health is reduced from your target if successfully hit. The higher the value, the more health is lowered.<br>Items with a damage value of zero, like grass, leaves, or string, is ineffective at inflicting damage to your target.<br><i>* Not yet implemented but planned</i></style>
- range
The item's <b>hit range</b> determines the <b>farthest distance</b> in meters it can <b>reach</b> when used on a target.<br>The <b>farther</b> the hit range, the <b>easier</b> it is to <b>hit your target</b> without it approaching too close.<br>The hit range of your <b>empty fists</b> is <b>1.4m.</b>
- cooldown
<style color=#c0a267>The item's cooldown time determines how long in seconds it takes to prepare for the next swing of the item to achieve its full striking effectiveness.<br>When you swing the weapon (or your empty fists), a cooldown indicator will appear at the at the bottom right of the screen, then disappears once the cooldown time has passed.<br>Each weapon's cooldown time is based on its weight and length. Heavy items like a pot filled with water or long items like a bamboo pole typically have high cooldown times.<br>Attempting to attack before the cooldown time is over will result in the following:<br>- much higher chance of missing the target, even if it is within hit range of your weapon<br>- greatly reduced damage on the target if it was hit<br><i>* Not yet implemented but planned</i></style>
- type
<style color=#c0a267>The item's hit type also plays a role in how much damage is inflicted to your target. The different hit types include fist, blunt, blade, and piercing.<br>Blunt weapons like bats and sledge hammers are generally more effective against heavily armored targets, whereas bladed wapons are not.<br>Piercing weapons like arrows and spears are more effective against targets with thick fur or hide.<br>Bladed weapons are most effective against uncovered flesh and other soft organic material.<br><i>* Not yet implemented but planned</i></style>
