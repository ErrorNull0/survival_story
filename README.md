SURVIVAL STORY

Developed by ErrorNull

for `Luanti 5.10.0+`

Survival Story is a game that incorporates survival mechanics inspired by games like 7 Days to Die, Project Zomboid, Don't Starve, and the RLCraft mod for Minecraft.

You spawn with nothing. Challenges become deadlier the farther out from spawn point you travel, to the point where they are near impossible to handle, guarding the next farthest region over the horizon. Be the player to survive the longest or explore the farthest into the distance.

There is also a unique story underlying the player's circumstance, hinting as to why they exist in this world, and why sleep and dreams are important.

Survival Story is very early in development and is planned to be a multi-year project. My goal is to create most features from scratch (and not rely on existing mods), so I can learn all aspects of the Luanti API in order to better optimize the game for multi-player. Any questions or comments let me know.

## Manual Install From .zip File
